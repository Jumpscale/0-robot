# Migration from 0.5.x to 0.6.x

In version 0.6.0, 0-robot has [force usage of HTTPS](https://github.com/zero-os/0-robot/issues/180). It means that all the 0-robot client you already have configured in your Jumpscale config manager needs to be update to point to the https URL.

To upgrade all your clients, you can use this small script:
```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse
for client in j.clients.zrobot.list():
    print('update client %s' % client.instance)
    u = urlparse(client.config.data['url'])
    url = "https://%s/%s" % (u.netloc, u.path)
    client.config.data_set('url', url)
```
